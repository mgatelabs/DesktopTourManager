# DesktopTourManager
Desktop app to create &amp; edit Mobile VR Station's *.tour files.

This is still under development, so things may not always work.

# Running

1. Download source
2. Install Node JS
3. From the source directory, run "npm install"
4. If the install worked, "npm start" to run the project

# Issues

1. This uses a image modification library to process images.  The process to install this module was messy and not fun.
